            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Aditya Srivastava, and I am an aspiring web developer. I was born and raised in Prayagraj, a small town in Uttar Pradesh. After completing my schooling at St. Joseph's College, my alma mater, with 92 percent in my Class 12 board examinations, I joined Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai, to pursue my ambition of becoming an Electronics and Communication Engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my first year at college, I was exposed to a wide range of opportunities to explore various skills, from pottery to robotics. However, I knew that it wasnâ€™t the time to commit to any one thing, but rather to absorb as much as I could, explore everything, and then decide which path to take.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was during the summer break that I came to the conclusion that, along with my core interest in Electronics, Web Development is a field where my passion truly lies. Henceforth, I began my journey into web development in May 2024.
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I ensured that I learned each concept with clarity and focus, giving every topic the time it deserved. I was careful not to rush into new topics without gaining confidence in the previous ones, avoiding the temptation to prematurely label myself a full-stack web developer. :)
